## Small Business Sale Tracking Application

This application provide easy digital transition for small businesses. Most shops rely on their A4 agenda to track their sales, by writing line by line every sale during day. My husband's shop is one of them. We spend long hours to prepare our tax returns, track our stock, and analyse our financial performance. To end this torture for us and all the businesses out there, I've started this project, digital sales and stock tracker.

## Development

This is the alpha version, only runs on local development server. Right now I'm working on deploy the app in a platform so I can start testing with beta users. If you want to contribute this process please contact me at cetinsdev@gmail.com and don't be disheartened because you just started and don't have any experience yet. We all had to start somewhere and this app is my starting point. I don't have any experience yet :)

## How To Clone

There are two repositories for this application. In order to run this, you should clone both of them seperately.

As I couldn't install MongoDB npm package on my Windows laptop, the instructions will only work on MacOS. Sorry for the inconvenience but as soon as I figure it out I'll update this file.

In order to install npm packages in this project make sure you installed node in your machine.

First create a folder in your machine, open your terminal and cd to the folder you created and use the commands below on your terminal

```
git clone git@github.com:Cetins/sale-tracker-client.git
```
```
git clone git@github.com:Cetins/sale-tracker-server.git
```

This will clone the both repositories to your folder than you should install npm for each repository you had cloned. 
```
cd sale-tracker-client
```
```
npm install
```
```
cd ../
```
```
cd sale-tracker-server
```
```
npm install
```
Then you should upload the sample data by runnind the seeds command
```
npm run seeds
```
After all these commands your project should be ready to run. 

To run your server you can use ```npm run server:dev``` command from the root of the sale-tracker-server directory.
To run your client you can use ``` npm start``` command from the root of the sale-tracker-client directory.

I would personally open two seperate terminal windows and run server and client. I don't like to clutter my code editor's internal terminal and save it for git commands.

## How to Contribute

I'm still figuring out things and learning on the go, so there arent any rules or guidelines. Feel free to clone and manipulate the code for your own use. But please contact me before creating a pull request to these repositories.
